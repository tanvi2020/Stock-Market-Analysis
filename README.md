Key Analysis & Insights 🔍
1️⃣ Daily Stock Price Movements
The difference between High and Low prices was calculated to understand price fluctuations. 📊
Greater daily difference indicates higher volatility. 📉📈

2️⃣ Stock Price Trend Analysis
To determine price direction:
Uptrend: Closing price > Opening price ✅
Downtrend: Closing price < Opening price ❌
The number of uptrend vs. downtrend days was counted for trend evaluation. 🔄

3️⃣ Trend Visualization 📊
Bar Charts were used to display uptrend (green) and downtrend (red) days. 🟩🟥
This visualization helped highlight long-term trends in stock performance.

4️⃣ Candlestick Chart Analysis 🕯️
A candlestick chart was used to visualize opening, closing, high, and low prices over time. 📅
Data was resampled to weekly/monthly intervals to capture long-term trends instead of daily fluctuations. 📆

Future Scope 🚀
📈 Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning to forecast stock price trends.
📅 Long-Term Insights: Study patterns across multiple years.
